# Mvc-Framework

Before you can start your project with this framework, you will have to make the following changes:
  1) Open the .htacces file in the public folder and change the "RewriteBase /MV-Framework/public" to your path
     So ONLY change the "Mvc-Framework" part to what you called your folder.
  
  2) Go in app folder and open the config.php in the config folder. Change the Database params, URLROOT and SITENAME.
